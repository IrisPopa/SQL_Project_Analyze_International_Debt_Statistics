# SQL_Project_Analyze_International_Debt_Statistics

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank by querying a database, filtering records, using aggregate functions, 
and sorting and grouping. Additionally, I created a magic cell %%sql to execute SQL code within Jupyter Notebook. 
The data used in this project was provided by The World Bank and includes national and regional debt statistics for multiple countries worldwide recorded 
from 1970 to 2015. The dataset provides information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories.

This is a guided project I have done on the DataCamp platform. In a guided project, learners are provided with a set of instructions and a specific goal to achieve using a real-world dataset.
